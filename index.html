				<h2>IoT based Elderly Monitoring System</h2>
				<p>
				  In my final year project, I embarked on a transformative journey to create an IoT-based Elderly Monitoring System. This comprehensive solution addresses the pressing need for advanced healthcare management. By ingeniously merging cutting-edge hardware and sophisticated software, I orchestrated a symphony of innovation that redefines real-time health monitoring.
				</p>
				<p>
				  Central to the project is a meticulously crafted mobile app developed using Flutter and Firebase. I seamlessly integrated this app with specialized hardware, equipped with a diverse array of sensors. These sensors diligently collected real-time health data from patients, seamlessly transmitting it to Firebase's real-time database. I harnessed devices like ESP32 and Arduino IDE to orchestrate this seamless data flow. The sensor suite was designed to measure heart rate, blood oxygen levels (SpO2), ECG data, body temperature, and even detect falls.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The app's dual user roles, catering to doctors and patients, reflect my commitment to holistic healthcare management. For doctors, the app serves as a comprehensive patient information hub, empowering them to make informed decisions based on real-time data insights. On the patient side, a tailored interface enables them to access and manage their health records with ease. The app's notification system played a pivotal role, instantly alerting both doctors and patients to any critical anomalies – a crucial feature for timely interventions.
				</p>
				<p>
				  My IoT based Elderly Monitoring System is more than just a project; it's a testament to my dedication to creating impactful solutions that bridge healthcare gaps. By seamlessly merging my app development skills with my hardware integration prowess, I've crafted a solution that stands as a beacon of innovation and a testament to my technical prowess.

				<h2>Smart Fish Aquarium</h2>
				<p>
				  Spearheading the creation of the Smart Fish Aquarium app, I embarked on an ambitious journey to merge the realms of Flutter and Firebase, culminating in the birth of an innovative platform. This project serves as a testament to my unwavering commitment to innovation and my ability to craft immersive user experiences that transcend traditional boundaries.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The app's foundation is built upon an intuitive user interface that seamlessly connects users with their aquatic havens. Upon entering the app, users are welcomed by a captivating splash screen that sets the tone for the underwater world they are about to explore. At the heart of the app lies the Dashboard, a digital command center that empowers users to monitor and manage critical aquarium metrics in real time.
				</p>
				<p>
				  Visual storytelling is woven into the app's DNA, transforming raw data into engaging visual narratives. This artistic approach fosters a profound connection between users and their aquatic companions. Underpinning this immersive experience is the seamless integration of Firebase services. With expertise in user authentication, Cloud Functions, Realtime Database management, and Firebase Messaging, I ensured the app delivered a secure, fluid, and intuitive user experience.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The Smart Fish Aquarium app is a microcosm of my proficiency in app development, encapsulating my ability to harmoniously blend Flutter's flexibility with Firebase's robust capabilities. By leveraging these technologies, I've created an application that exemplifies my commitment to innovation, creativity, and technical finesse.

				<h2>AL-Khalid 1.0</h2>
				<p>
				  AL-Khalid 1.0 stands as a testament to my innovative spirit and technical prowess. This project was an ambitious endeavor that resulted in the creation of a fully-functional tank prototype equipped with advanced features. The tank was designed to revolutionize defense mechanisms with its cutting-edge technology.
				</p>
				<p>
				  At the heart of AL-Khalid 1.0 is a microcontroller, Arduino, which served as the brain of the tank. This microcontroller was programmed using the Arduino IDE, allowing us to integrate complex functionalities seamlessly. The tank was equipped with a mounted gun, capable of aiming and accurately shooting at targets. This precision was achieved through a camera-enhanced defense system that boasted an impressive accuracy rate of 95%.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The design and engineering of AL-Khalid 1.0 involved a multidisciplinary approach, combining robotics, electronics, and software development. The tank's motors were carefully selected to ensure smooth movement and precise control. As a result, AL-Khalid 1.0 not only demonstrated my coding skills but also showcased my ability to translate innovative ideas into tangible and functional prototypes.
				</p>
				<p>
				  The success of AL-Khalid 1.0 extended beyond the prototype stage. This project garnered attention and interest from the Heavy Industry of Taxila, where it was planned for further development on a larger scale. AL-Khalid 1.0 exemplifies my commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and harnessing its potential to create solutions that make a meaningful impact.
